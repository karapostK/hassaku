# Recommender System Algorithms

This repository contains some of the algorithms that have been proposed in the filed of Recommender Systems. The focus is on Collaborative Filtering approaches but maybe in the future this could be extended with Hybrid/Content models.

[See this notebook for a quick glance at the results of the algorithms](https://gitlab.cp.jku.at/alessandro/rec-algs/-/blob/main/RecommenderSystemApproaches.ipynb)
