This repository hosts the code for a recommender system framework written in Python and Pytorch maintained by me.
In particular the framework contains the main procedures for data processing, training, hyperparameter optimization, testing, logging, and several recommender system algorithms (collaborative filtering).

See Structure.md for the overall description of the folders.
